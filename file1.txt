Split string into tokens
A sequence of calls to this function split str into tokens, which are sequences of contiguous characters 
separated by any of the characters that are part of delimiters.
On a first call, the function expects a C string as argument for str, 
whose first character is used as the starting location to scan for tokens. 
In subsequent calls, the function expects a null pointer and uses 
the position right after the end of the last token as the new starting location for scanning.
